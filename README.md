# Diabetes Prediction

* This repository applies K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to a diabetes prediction dataset filtered for pregnant individuals, using data from the https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set.*

## Overview

The task is to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals who have experienced at least one pregnancy using a structured dataset with health measurements. We treat this as a binary supervised classification problem. My approach involves cleaning the dataset, selecting relevant features, scaling the data, and training a KNN model to classify individuals based on nearest neighbors in the feature space. The best model achieved approximately 79% accuracy and an AUC of 0.84 on the test set, indicating strong performance with a simple algorithm on a small dataset.

## Summary of Workdone

### Data

* Data:
  * Type: Tabular data in CSV format.
    * Input: 8 numeric features including Glucose, BMI, Age, and Pregnancies
    * Output:  Binary variable (Outcome) indicating presence of diabetes.
  * Size: 768 instances (before filtering)
  * Instances 650 pregnant individuals (After filtering)
  * Train Test Split: 80%-20%
  * Validation: Performed with 5-fold cross-validation 

#### Preprocessing / Clean up

* Dropped Id column as irrelevant
* Filtered dataset to include only individuals with Pregnancies > 0
* Replaced zeroes in Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, and BMI with NaN
* Imputed missing values using the mean
* Applied StandardScaler to all features
* Used SMOTE to balance classes in the training data

These graphs show that diabetic individuals (orange) generally have higher glucose levels, more pregnancies, and slightly higher Diabetes Pedigree Function values compared to non-diabetics (blue), highlighting key differences between the two groups.
A heatmap was used to visualize correlations, revealing strong correlation between Glucose and Outcome

### Problem Formulation

* Define:
  * Input: 8 numerical features (Glucose, BloodPressure, Insulin, BMI, etc.)
  * Output: Binary classification (0 = non-diabetic, 1 = diabetic)
  * Models
    *K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
       *Tuned using n_neighbors from 1â€“20
       *Chosen for its suitability with small datasets and interpretability

### Training
 * Environment: Google Colab (default CPU)
 * Training time: Instantaneous (non-iterative training)
 * KNN requires no training phase; instead, it stores the training data
 * Hyperparameters tuned manually via cross-validation (choosing best k)

### Performance Comparison
Model	                 Accuracy	  AUC
KNN                    0.82       0.90
Logisitcal Regression  0.77       0.84
### Conclusions

* Both models performed well, with KNN providing the best accuracy and AUC.
* Feature scaling and class balancing (SMOTE) improved model stability.
* Glucose and BMI were key predictors, while Pregnancies had moderate positive correlation with diabetes outcome.
